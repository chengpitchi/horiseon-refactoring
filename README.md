# Horiseon Refactoring Task 

## Description

This is the Challenge after completing the Unit 1 of Adelaide University Coding Bootcamp. 

## User Story

AS A marketing agency <br>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards <br>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards <br>
WHEN I view the source code <br>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements <br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements <br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning <br>
WHEN I view the icon and image elements <br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes <br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes <br>
THEN they fall in sequential order <br>
WHEN I view the title element <br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title 

## Solution 

The following changes are made to the HTML file:
1. Change the title to a meaning description in the head tag. 
2. Add viewport attribute in the head tag. 
3. Specify the type of the link in the head tag. 
4. Review the attributes in head tag to ensure they are in proper ordering. 
5. Change the div tags to header, nav, article, aside, section and footer tag. 
6. Add title attribute for the div tag with background image. 
7. Add alt attribute for the images in the img tag. 
8. Add the missing #Id attribute to the search engine optimization section. 

The following changes are made to the CSS file:
1. Change the corresponding class selectors to element selectors. 
2. Group the repeated class selectors with the same styles to the corresponding section selectors. 
3. Remove the repeated class seelctors from the file. 
4. Examine and ensure the order of the selectors lised in the file following the logical sequence.
